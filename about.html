I'm a composer and musician based in London.
I've been playing and writing music for over 20 years in a wide range of styles and situations.

I previously worked as a software developer for 5 years, but recently I've made audio my primary focus.
This experience helps particularly in interactive audio, as I'm comfortable digging into code to manage audio integration, as well as to fix the occasional bug.
I'm also familiar with a range of agile methodologies.
