**Hi! I'm Dave. I'm a composer and creative coder, currently based in London.** 
I've worked on:
- **[Albedon Wars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/867470/Albedon_Wars/)** - all audio (featuring a highly adaptive soundtrack)
- **[The Dreadful Whispers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1112340/The_Dreadful_Whispers/)** - soundtrack

I like to develop small games that can be found on my **[Itch page](https://daveallenbpm.itch.io)**.

I'm also an experienced **programmer** with over 5 years of professional experience.
