I'm a composer and musician based in London.
I've been playing and writing music for over 20 years in a wide range of styles and situations.

I've worked as a software developer for 5 years, but recently I've chosen to make audio my main focus.
With this programming experience, I'm comfortable digging into code to manage audio integration for interactive media, as well as diving in to fix the occasional bug.
I'm familiar the usual suspects (VCS, TDD, CI), and have also experienced working in a range of agile methodologies, which aid in providing structure and communication.
