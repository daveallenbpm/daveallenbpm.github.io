I'm a composer and musician based in London.
I've been playing and writing music for over 20 years in a wide range of styles and situations.

Having worked as a software developer for the last 5 years (skilled in C# and Javascript), I can integrate audio in a range of interactive environments.

I'm a skilled pianist (to DipABRSM level) and guitarist. This allows me to provide quick feedback through improvisation around themes and motifs, to ensure you get the sounds you need.

If you'd like to get in touch, please use the contact info at the bottom of this page.
