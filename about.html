**I'm a composer and sound designer based in London.**
**I'm currently working as the composer and sound designer for _[Albedon Wars](http://www.albedonwars.com/)_.** This game features a dynamic soundtrack, implemented in FMOD.

I previously worked as a software developer for 5 years.
With this programming experience, I'm comfortable digging into code to manage audio integration for interactive media.
If you'd like to know more about my experience in software, take a look at my [tech CV](files/DaveAllenTechCV.pdf).
